<h1>Active Directory</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
As part of a hands-on project, I successfully designed and implemented an Active Directory environment on Windows Server 2019, utilizing PowerShell scripts to efficiently create 1000 users at a time. This project also involved configuring DNS (Domain Name System) and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) services in conjunction with Active Directory. Additionally, I demonstrated proficiency in creating organizational units, managing users, and administering groups to enhance network organization and security.
